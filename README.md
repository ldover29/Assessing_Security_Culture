# Assessing_Security_Culture
Showcasing knowledge of "Governance, Risk, and Compliance" in regards to a fictional company called SilverCorp


# Step 1: Measure and Set Goals

Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.
Allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices can lead to phishing/downloading of malware, an insider attack from a disgruntled employee, or sniffing if the employees use their devices outside of work on an unsecure WiFi network. 
Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
Some preferred behaviors include:
Employees should not be opening emails, downloading attachments/files or clicking through to links from senders they do not recognize.
Employees should not be using their personal devices to access work related data such as emails, client info, etc. If this must be done for any reason, all employees must connect through a VPN.
Employees must avoid using their devices on unsecure networks, especially when using their device for work related tasks.
Employees should change their passwords and implement two-factor authentication for devices and software.
Employees must take advantage of encrypting data
What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?


Send fake phishing emails and log the number of employees who click on the link provided. Repeat offenders will be made note of.
Keep a list of all employee’s IP addresses and logging how many unfamiliar address try to access the company’s network
What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?


Once the numbers come in for the methods stated above, there will be a more realistic goal to place on the organization. In the meantime, all click throughs of the phishing emails should be well under 5%
As for the employees using their personal devices, it was mentioned that 50% use their phones for Slack and 25% of employees are using work accounts to access work data, etc. This number percentage needs to  be cut in half.
Step 2: Involve the Right People
Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
CEO
The CEO will keep meetings with the executives of the organization. Discussions about any information, updates of the security plan and what improvements need to be made will be had amongst themselves. The CEO will also report to the board of directors and will explain the overall direction of the company once the security precautions are put in place.
CISO
The CISOs will manage the risk to the organization's data. They will keep the organization aware of any hiccups in the plan to mitigate risks at SilverCorp.
CIO
The CIO will develop IT systems that will support the business in cybersecurity. The CIOs will enforce the technical aspect of the plan. They will also report to the CEO of any progress and updates when required.
COO
The COOs will be in charge of any courses, presentations, surveys, training and awareness of security threats and threat actors. They will also report to the CEO with any progress and updates.
Manager or HR representative
These individuals will ensure passwords are being changed on a regular basis, communicate any/all security risks, monitor for physical theft, educate the employees on how to use the VPN as they have a closer connection to the staff
Step 3: Training Plan
Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)
Training will consist of both in-person and online sessions that require mandatory attendance. The entire training process will be done annually, lasting for about one business week. Each session will last 45 minutes, so that employees can maintain a better attention span during the training. In-person training is preferred due to the fact that online sessions can not guarantee a full attendance or attention. 
To better gauge employee knowledge, a mandatory online quiz on all the topics mentioned will be taken before the training week. 
What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)
The in-person sessions will cover the importance of cybersecurity, following policy and maintaining good employee behavior through presentations, lessons and quizzes. 
Topics like: 
The dangers of phishing emails and how they can appear as emails from upper management or a reputable/ popular company like amazon. It will be made very clear not to click any links and that upper management will never ask for phone numbers, passwords, or favours (like buying gift cards) through email.  
How destructive downloading malware can be. The existence and function of viruses, trojans, worms, ransomware will be taught and discussed. It will be explained that malware can be downloaded and work behind the scenes without knowledge.
The importance of using a VPN, 
The risk of using a personal device for work related tasks and physical theft will be discussed. The risk of unsecure internet networks will be covered, as well as how sniffing, brute forcing and code injection work and could possibly go hand in hand. It will then be explained that not only can the organization’s data be easily breached on a personal device, but so can the individual’s personal data.
How to protect personal devices with complex passwords, two factor authentication, VPNs, firewalls, antivirus software, etc.
The alternatives and steps that need to be taken to ensure cybersecurity. For example, changing passwords, prohibited use of personal devices for work related tasks, logging out of sessions when away from the computer, confidentiality contracts, 
After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?
After training week has ended, another mandatory online quiz will be taken afterward to see if any and all information was retained during training week.
Also, fake phishing emails will be sent out regularly with the number of employees who click on the link provided being logged. All Repeat offenders will be made note of and must repeat training. If employees still refuse to follow policy, they will be terminated. This process will be repeated until the goal of under 5% click-throughs is met.
This portion will require additional outside research on the topic so that you can lay out a clear and thorough training agenda.
Bonus: Other Solutions
Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern.
Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:
Encrypting data
Back up data



What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?
Encrypting data is a technical control
Backing up data is also a technical control
What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?
Encrypting data is a deterrent control because it discourages cyber criminals from accessing important data
Backup data is a compensating control because if a breach were to happen, the backup data will help the organization recover after being compromised.
What is one advantage of each solution?
The advantage of data encryption is that it separates the data from the device it is stored on. Encryption allows extra security, so administrators can store and transmit data on unsecured networks. This would be a good solution for employees who insist on using their personal devices for work related tasks.
		The advantage of backing up data is that it is easy and cost effective.
What is one disadvantage of each solution?
A disadvantage of data encryption is that it can be expensive due to constant upgrading and the need for more storage capacity of the systems.
A disadvantage of backing up data is that storage systems, like the cloud, can still be subject to attacks. Once cyber criminals get a hold of the back up data, the organization will lose everything and have a hard time recovering.
